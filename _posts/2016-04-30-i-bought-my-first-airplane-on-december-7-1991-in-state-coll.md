The Idea

I bought my first airplane on December 7, 1991 in State College, PA. A Bellanca Cruisair 14-13-2, N86728, Ser\# 1089\. I hangared the plane at the Greenville Downtown Airport (KGMU). One of our first trips in the plane was to Hartsville, SC to visit Jane's mother. Shortly after taking off from GMU, heading to the the SE and still climbing - we passed over what looked to me like a grass strip about 10 miles from GMU, I made a mental note. A few months later, same trip to Hartsville and again I saw the same grass strip. Around 1990 I inquired at the Williamsport private airpark on the NE side of Easley about lots that were for sale there, at that time there were only a few houses there. I began to consider buying a lot at Williamsport; my recollection is that the lot purchase terms were $10K for a 1 acre lot, 10% down, 10% interest for 10 years. Another way to make build a house at an airpark was to find some land and develop an airpark myself.

The 'airstrip' I saw on a couple of trips to Hartsville was worth looking into - just go out and find it and look for the owner. I flew out to the area I remembered seeing it in, flew around in circles, searched for it more than once and could not find it. Went back to GMU, landed, took off again and started out on a flight towards Hartsville - a few minutes later I found it. I had an early handheld Trimble GPS unit, captured its location, flew around the area and sketched the roads from there to Simpsonville and then landed back at GMU. Drove to Simpsonville and followed the landmarks and roads I diagrammed, went straight to the 'airfield'. I found a metal farm gate along Stewart Road just past the old peach packing shed, parked there and walked along the tractor path to the 'runway'. It was grown up completely to over waist high, but it looked like a runway - long, straight and wide. Walked back to my truck and found another truck with two men standing there.

Introduced myself to Harold Cooper and his companion. The runway and surrounding 107 acres belonged to Harold. He told me that another person a decade earlier had bought the land from him, carved in a runway and tried to develop an airpark. I did some research and found that a previous developer had proposed at least three plans for a residential airpark surrounding a runway - one scheme of about 45 lots, one of around 24 lots, and one of 8 lots - all in succession trying to capture buyers. After trying for a few years to make it happen, he stopped making mortgage payments to Harold and paying county taxes; Harold had to go after the arrears payments and pay the county back taxes to get the land title back.

I had initial discussions with Harold about my plans and his willingness to sell the property. After the first discussions I continued to scout around the southern Greenville County area and into adjoining counties for any other suitable airpark tracts - I found nothing as good Harold's property. At one of the early meetings with Harold he told me that he would not take less than $5000 per acre for the 107 acres. When I came back to Harold after about three months of planning and pulling a proposal together, he said the price per acre was $7500\. I reminded him that he had told me earlier that the price was $5000; he corrected me that he didn't say that the price was $5000 - he said that he wouldn't take less than $5000, that was different. We agreed to move forward at a price of $7500 per acre and I would start creating a development package.

After getting onto its history I found a few reasons why the plans for an airpark did not pan out for the previous developer. First, he was over extended with this project and development projects elsewhere. Second, the economy was in a mild recession, buyers were scarce. Third, and likely the biggest problem was that during the grading of the runway, the weather was very dry and lots of silt went airborne and floated into an adjoining neighbor's swimming pool just off of the NE end of the runway, apparently in large quantities. Another dispute with that land owner was over a sliver of property between both tracts, maybe around a tenth of an acre. Both of these issues became legal bouts, which may have turned off potential buyers, discouraging them from buying a lot. It all boiled down to the wind not blowing from the right direction, and not enough rain or money falling from the sky - bad timing.

But I was off and running.
