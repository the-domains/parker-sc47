            <description><![CDATA[<p>I bought my first airplane on December 7, 1991 in State College, PA. A Bellanca Cruisair, 14-13-2 - N86728, Ser# 1089. I hangared the plane at the Greeville Downtown Airport (KGMU). One of our first trips in the plane was to Hartsville, SC to visit Janeâ€™s mother. Shortly after taking off from GMU, heading to the the SE and still climbing - we passed over what looked to me like a grass strip about 10 miles from GMU, I made a mental note. A few months later, same trip to Hartsville and again I saw the same grass strip. In 1994 I inquired at the Williamsport private airpark on the NE side of Easley about lots that were for sale there, at that time it was still. I began to consider buying one. Another thought was to find some land and start an airpark.</p>]]></description>
